I'm a senior offensive security engineer with most of my experience in penetration testing. I enjoy writing buggy Python tools and learning about Active Directory. 

I hold the OSCP and [CRTO](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/VnFfDX96TlG8vAspRQVjbA) certifications.

I occasionally blog here, but more frequently on the [Fortalice Solutions blog](https://www.fortalicesolutions.com/blog). Topics there include:
